Micro PDCA - Doing the "D"
================

This code example uses Grails 2.2.2 and Spock 0.7 to show how the PDCA concept can be applied to a development cycle.

- **Running the tests**

Assuming you have Grails 2.2.2 installed, just open a terminal/command prompt and type:

	grails test-app

- **Checking Code Coverage**

Assuming you have Grails 2.2.2 installed, just open a terminal/command prompt and type:

	grails test-app -coverage

The coverage reports are generated inside the folder _target/test-reports/cobertura_
